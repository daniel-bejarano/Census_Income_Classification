# Census_Income_Classification
EDA and Classification of Income Classes on an Imbalanced Dataset

Overview:
Utilizing data obtained from UCI Machine Learning Repository, the goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can classify the correct income-level category for people in the US using various features found in Census data.

It's a multiclass, supervised classification problem. However, it's also an IMBALANCED dataset. The main interest of the analysis in this notebook is to deal with class imbalances in a dataset (when one of the classes is much more prevalent than the other).
